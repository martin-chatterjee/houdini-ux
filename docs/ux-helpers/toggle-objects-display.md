# Toggle Objects Display

---
### â†’ Demo Hotkey:  `Alt + H`

---
Toggles the individual **visibility states** of selected Objects:

![isolate-selection](../assets/images/toggle-visibility.gif)

- In contrast to [Isolate Selection](../isolate-selection/) this actually **toggles the individual display flags** of selected Objects.

- Naturally this only works in **Objects** mode.

- Let's you easily `'A/B'` things by **multi-selecting one visible and one hidden object**, and repeatedly hitting `Alt+H`.
